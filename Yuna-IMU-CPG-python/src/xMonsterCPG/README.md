# xMonsterCPG
An adaption of old snake monster CPG code to the xMonster in Python. 

Robot is able to walk with IMU stablization using CPG. 

We also have a visualization and simple kinematic state estimator working in ROS.

Requirements
------------

You need Python 2.7 or Python 3.x or later to run mypy.  You can have multiple Python
versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.

#Python Packages:
-Numpy

You need to have a ros distribution on your computer as well. This code has been tested on kinetic and melodic. 




Getting Started
-----
Running the main CPG Node:
Running the visualization:



TODO
